Search and Sort Program

Purpose:

Demonstrate the ability to create and execute a C++ program that utilizes complex data structures
to perform searching and sorting.

Assignment:

Write a program that will perform sorting and searching across records stored in a file.
The program should first query the user for a filename. The program should open the file and read
the first entry. It defines the number of records in the file. The program should read each record
and store it into memory. Each record in the file will have sets of three lines. Each set consists of:
lastname, firstname, and birthdate.

Your program should prompt the user for a command:

  Searching - The user should be able to supply a search value and your program should
  print any entries that start with that value. You should search all first names, last names,
  and birthdates. There may be multiple values returned.

  Sorting - The user should be able to choose to print the data in its original unsorted form,
  sorted by first name, or sorted by last name.

  Quit â€“ Exit the program

Code must be well commented.

Deliverables: 

You must submit your homework through ELearning. You must include your .cpp files and your
input file.

Input File Format:

The input file is a text file that contains a number of records. The first line in the file contains an
integer that describes how many records the file contains. After the first line, you will have sets of
three lines.

Each set consists of:

Lastname
Firstname
Birthdate
An example file would be:
